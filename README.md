## General information
This is a "portfolio" page for potential recruitment; however, this is unnecissary. As a gainfully employeed cyber security professional whose tuition has been paid for by their employer, rather than advertising to potential employers this project has been used to advertize skills, current and beyond, as it pertains to the current field of employment and the subcultures that exist therein.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
HTML5
ECMAScript 2021
CSS4
Bootstrap5
	
## Setup
To run this project please launch https://izzyatmit.github.io/ in a modern web browser.

* Encorporating the landing page into the main site and allowing the codefall to disolve behind the main page to allow it to be seen.
